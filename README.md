# DS-Project1-Data-Storytelling
Analyzing data and visualizing insights from last minutes scores in 2017-2018 lead me to find what probably were the most exciting teams in Spain's professional soccer league that season.

There are two notebooks:
* DS1_Project1_LaLiga_ClutchGrading: includes code used to pull data from API and initial analysis.
* DS_Project1_Data_Storytelling: contains final visualizations with their code.

Concluding analysis and visualizations can be seen in [post in my portfolio website](http://carlosgutier.com/2018-11-26-clutch-soccer-goals-in-la-liga/).
